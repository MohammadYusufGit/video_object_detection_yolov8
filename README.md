### YOLOv8 Video Object Detection

This repository contains a Python implementation for performing real-time object detection in video files using the YOLOv8 model. It processes video frames to detect objects such as "person" and "motorcycle," and outputs a new video with annotated frames, including bounding boxes and class labels.

#### Features:
- Object detection using the YOLOv8 model.
- Real-time video processing with frame-by-frame inference.
- Detection of specific classes (e.g., "person," "motorcycle").
- Bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores.
- Outputs a processed video with annotations.

#### Requirements:
Python 3.x,
OpenCV,
Ultralytics YOLOv8,
IPython,
